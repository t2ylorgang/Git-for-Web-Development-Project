    1. What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic html is HTML that's content is clearly described to the browser and developer. It's meaning is clearly understood with the element's name. For example, a <img> element is semantic becuse its meaning is clearly understood by the browser and developer. We know this will be an image and its content will be an image. Where as with a <div>, the name "div" doesn't clearly describe anything about its content.

An id is an html attribute that is used to specify a unique id for an html element. You can only use one ID for an html element with the same name in an html document. It gives a specific element it's own unique name and allows you to be very accurate and only manipulate that one specific element you give the id name to.

ID attributes can be used by all HTML tags

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page?

    10. What is a class?
A class is an html attribute that specifies a "class" for an HTML element or elements. Unlike ID, more than one element can have a class with the same name. This allows us to style multiple elements the same way at the same time. A developer can change all the text color for <p> tags with the class="fun" for example.

    18. How do we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
In the css file to select all h2 elements on the page we would simply write h2 and then use curly braces to insert our styles we want for every h2 element on the page.

h2 {
font-size: 36px;
}

This code above would change every h2 to font size 36px.

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an      example of when I might use each one
A class is for when you want to style multiple elements at once from one place in the css file and an id is when you want to select one specific html element to style. For example you could use class to add a border to all <p> tags on the web page and you could use ID to pick one specific <p> tag that you did NOT want to have a border on.

}

A parent child selector is a selector that allows you to grab all the elements that are a direct child of another element to style them. This would be useful if you only wanted to style the <p> tags in a specific div. You could style them all without having to add a class name to each <p> tag within that div.

}

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block         element?
Block level elements will ALWAYS create a new line on the page. Inline elements will appear one after the other on the page on the same line.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
The element is removed from the normal document flow and is given no space on the page layout. It is just placed reletive to the intiial containing block. It uses top, right, bottom, and left to determine its final position on the page.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it       needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
You must use display inline-block

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
<div> <h1> <p>
<a> <img>
<button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

All html elements have an imaginary box around them. The different sections of this box around the HTML element are margin, border, and padding (outside-in); with the content as the warm delicious center.  Margin affects the space on the very outside of this box, just inside the margin you can add and edit the border, inside of the border we can add space between the border and the content using padding. We can use min width and max width to make elements respect the width we have given them.
